I began by setting up the basic structure of the landing page using HTML, ensuring that all sections were properly defined. Then, I styled the page with CSS, focusing on creating a visually appealing and responsive design. After completing the design, I thoroughly tested the page to ensure everything worked as expected. Finally, I pushed the code to GitHub and made it live and accessible.
